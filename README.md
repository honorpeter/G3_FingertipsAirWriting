# ECE532 - Fingertip Air-Writing Recognition on FPGA
Our goal is to build a system that translates fingertip movements in the air into English characters without any hardware peripherals on the userâ€™s hand. The system should track the position of the fingertip using a video camera input and translate fingertip movements into English characters. The recognized characters will then be sent to the Internet for further processing and applications. By connecting the device to the Internet, we can explore many potential applications of air-writing recognition, for example, text messaging, web browsing, home remote control and virtual reality.

How to run the program:
-----------------------
1. Import nexys4_ddr board files from https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards
2. Open the project ece532_project
3. Generate the bitstream and export to SDK
4. Launch SDK, program FPGA and create new configuration
5. Run the project
